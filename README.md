# murder_dos_newlines

* Do you work on a codebase where devs use both Windows and Mac?

* Do they use an inferior point-and-click based text editor that pays no regard to newlines?

* Are you an elevated Vim user that's tired of seeing those pesky `^M` characters, indicated mixed Dos and Windows newlines?

* Have you tried to set things in `~/.vimrc`, like `set ff=dos`, to no avail?

## Introducing Murder Dos Newlines

Murder Dos Newlines murders dos newlines, recursively of course.

To murder dos newlines, run this script in the root of your project directory.

## Now git is saying scary words. Help!

Don't worry, those git words won't hurt you like `git reset --hard` will.
